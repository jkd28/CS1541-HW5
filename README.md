# Threading Performance Analysis
This was a project I completed for my Computer Architecture class at the University of Pittsburgh (COE 1541).  The goal of the project was to use Matrix Multiplication to examine the benefits of threading and mutex locking in computational problems.  I was required to run several test cases and document the results in order to perform my analysis.  My analysis is included in `Q1_Discussion.txt`.

For the second part of the assignment, I was required to provide pseudocode that describes a parallel computing process in a recursive "tree" implementation.  The solution I provided is in `pseudo_question2.txt`
